	General Information
	----------------------

	- All data types used in this interface are ANSI C compatible.

	- All returns that indicate "true if succeed, false if fail" are defined
		as:  1 = true = Success , 0 = false = failure

		Functions that are not entirely upper case do not correspond directly to 
		an FTM or diagnostic command. 

		For example, QLIB_ConnectServer() is not mapped directly to a diagnostic 
		command.

			
	- Variable Names
		Variable names are prefixed in lower case to indicate the data type.
		The following are defined:

			p = Pointer
			i = Integer type, either char, short, or long
			d = Double or floating point
			e = Enumeration (possibly stored as a short, but representing 
			                 a fixed list of possibilities)
			b = unsigned char, 0=false, 1=true

	----------------------
	Related Documents 
	----------------------

	- The function name convention used in this document is as follows:

		QLIB_ indicates that this function corresponds to library function
		in the QLib project.

		From there, all diagnostic and FTM functions are named exactly as
		the command identifiers are defined in the QLib_Defines.h.

		For a list of all documents referred to by QMSL, please see following seciton in the QDART Help file:

	are mapped to unique numbers, depending on which devices have been installed in 
	the past.

	The port mapping process can be facilitated by the GetAvailablePhonesPortList() 
	function, which returns a list of which ports have a phone installed.  A "calibration"

	association in a persistant way (such as the registry or INI file), then when 
	their software starts up the software would first call ClearPortAliasList(),
	then call AddPortAliasEntry() for each logical/physical port association.

	NOTE: It is not necessary to ClearPortAliasList(), if not alias have been created
	      in the current run-time session.  In other words, the alias list is empty

			For example 0003/04 is a subsystem value of 3 a RT_MASK of 16, which is (2^4)
			Another example 6002/01 is a subsystem value of 0x1772 and a RT mask of 1, which is (2^1)

			side (QMSL) doesn't do any averaging.  If customer wants to change/define
			the number of averaging, they need to 1) change the embedded side FTM
			behavior and 2) change the PC side (by extending QMSL).  To extend the PC
			side, they can use SendSync function.  Keep in mind that QMSL is just a PC
			wrapper to all FTM functions.  In this case, it is just a wrapper of
			functions documented in CL93-V5370-1 (GSM FTM).

			2. Since QMSL is just a PC side wrapper on FTM function, you can look up the
			embedded side implementation to see how RSSI value is defined/derived.  You
			should be able to trace through the FTM dispatch table on embedded side.

	Factory Test Mode GSM Commands 3.22 Rx gain range cal

	This command combines a number of steps required to perform Rx gain range calibration across frequencies.

	The traditional method of performing gain range calibration involved the following steps:
	\code
       1. Set Mode.
       2. Set Channel 1.
       3. Turn RX on.
       4. Set gain range 0.
       5. Get RSSI.
       6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 through all gain ranges.
       7. Set Channel 2.
       8. Repeat steps 4 through 6, etc.
	\endcode

	This API now accepts a bit mask to specify which gain ranges are being calibrated and returns the
	RSSI for all those gain ranges in a single command, i.e., it combines steps 5 and 6 above into a
	single command. In addition, it also turns the receiver on/off based on input from the user.
	18 The modified method of performing the gain range calibration is now:
	\code
       1. Set Mode.
       2. Set Channel 1.
       3. Call Rx gain range cal command with:
          a. gain_range_bitmask = 0xF (for 4 gain ranges) or 0x1F (for 5 gain ranges)
          b. Number of Burst to Average set to some number greater than 1
          c. Toggle RX on/off set to TRUE (this will cause the phone to turn on the receiver)
       4. Read the response of Rx gain range cal with the result in the RSSI Result field.
       5. Set Channel 2.
       6. Call Rx gain range cal command as in step 3, but set Toggle RX on/off field to FALSE.
       7. Read the response of the command.
       8. Continue for the remaining channels.
       9. Set the last channel number.
       10. Call Rx gain range cal 1 command as in step 3, i.e., set Toggle RX on/off field to TRUE.
           This should cause the phone to turn off the receiver after making measurements for the last

	Factory Test Mode GSM Polar Command 2.11 GSM_DETECTOR_CAL
	
	This API is used to calibrate the transmit RF chipset's output power to expected levels. 

	This is required to ensure that process variations do not cause variation in output power across different phones. 
	
	This must be done prior to FTM_GSM_POLAR_TX_SWEEP_CAL, which is used to calibrate the PA's non-linearity. 


	In order to calibrate the RF chip's output power, the RF gain setting is varied and an internal power 
	detector is read. This command then searches through different gain settings until a required power detector 
	reading is obtained. 
	
	The inputs to this command are the required power detector setting (in units of unsigned 8-bits) 
	and a tolerance value. The command then settles to a power detector setting in the range - 
	Required detector settings - tolerance <= final reading <= Required detector settings + tolerance

	Once this calibration is completed, the resulting value is programmed to hardware.  

	In addition, the command computes the gain settings required for cold temperature and 
	hot temperature conditions.  These values are optionally stored in NV for future use during 
	temperature compensation. The command also accepts a flag specifying whether the resulting 
	gain settings (at cold, room and hot temperature) should be stored to NV. 
	
	When the flag is true, the results are stored to NV. 
	The NV item names used are:  
	\code
       NV_<band>_PA_TEMP_COMP_INDEX_10_I.

			                  -                             = max( room temp setting - 20, 0)

               - NV_<band>_PA_TEMP_COMP_INDEX_10_I.value[1] = room temp setting.
               - NV_<band>_PA_TEMP_COMP_INDEX_10_I.value[2] =  high temp setting.
                                                            = min( room temp setting + 60, 255)

	Factory Test Mode GSM Polar Command 2.12 TX_4xFMOD_SWEEP
	
	This API is used to measure the RF setting that yields the lowest spur at the 4xfMod frequency. 
	The 4xfMod frequency is offset from the modulating frequency by 4 times the modulating frequency. 

	The modulating frequency used in this command is 13/192 MHz or 67.7kHz. Therefore this spur 
	would be at 67.7+4*67.7 = 5*67.7 kHz or at 67.7-4*67.7 = -3*67.7kHz. 
	
	Each possible set of RF settings that can affect this spur is identified by a unique index. 

	This command turns on the transmitter and steps through all possible indices. 

	The first step is considered a trigger and the RF setting for this step should be ignored. 
	In order to trigger the measurement instrument on the first step, the user must first call the 
	FTM_SET_TWOTONE_FREQ_OFFSET api to set the frequency offset to the 4xfMod frequency. 
	This will generate a tone at the 4xfmod frequency for the first step. 

	Following this, the remainder of the steps will each be programmed at one of the possible 
	RF indices. Thus steps 2 - N of the sweep will cycle through RF settings 1 to (N-1). 
	The command accepts the following 2 inputs:

		1.	The duration of each step in units of symbols (i.e 3.69us). The duration must not 
		    be set very low, or else the measuring instrument will not be able to distinguish 
			between steps. This number may be chosen based on the measurement resolution.

		2.	The trigger level (in units of DAC level). This turns on the transmitter to the 
		    specified DAC level. In the first step this transmit power will be at the frequency 
			offset specified by FTM_SET_TWOTONE_FREQ_OFFSET. Following the first step, this 
			transmit power will move to 67.7 kHz.

	The measurement box (spectrum analyzer) must be setup to measure the spur at the specified 
	4xfmod frequencies to capture this sweep. The user (or program that calls this API) may then 
	gather results of this sweep and write the best index to NV item name - NV_<band>_PA_TEMP_COMP_INDEX_11_I. 

	Note - This command will not write to NV. The user is responsible for measuring the sweep,

	More information about RX_QUAL:

	In brief, the mobile measures the Rx qual as defined in 3GPP 45.08.

	There are two rx qual thresholds calculated namely rx qual full and rx qual sub on the downlink 
	radio bursts. These two measure the radio's downlink quality over a single reporting period and 
	report the measurements to the network ( measurement reporting period is104 frames for tch channel) 
	so that the network has some information as to 'how the mobile see's the downlink radio quality'.

	Rx qual full is where the mobile makes quality threshold measurements on all downlink burst, ie tch, 
	facch and sacch blocks utilizing burst information from the equalizer output for all 104 bursts 
	on the downlink.

	Rx Qual Sub is a sub set of these 104 bursts. This is where the mobile only uses for quality 
	measurements the SACCH blocks and the Silent Identifier (SID) frames. This is the scenario where 
	there is no speech or signaling frames on the downlink to measure the downlink quality. The mobile 
	will always have information in these frames as the network will always send SACCH frames and if no 
	signaling or speech frames to transmit then it sends SID frames at specific radio blocks instead of 
	signaling or speech frames, these frames are identified as SID frames. This Rx Qual sub is therefore 
	an accurate measure of the quality of the downlink on a subset of the 104 burst.

	Therefore in a measurement report from the mobile to the network, the rx qual full might be 7 
	(ie poor) and the rx sub might be 0 (ie good) when no signaling/speech information is on the downlink.

	PRBS would imply signal being generated all the time and hence the rx qual full would be 0, ie a 
	full set of downlink bursts to process.

	ECHO would imply some silence in the downlink and hence the rx qual full would be 7 as 
	there is poor data to measure quality on

		GSDI commands with Event response.

		This group of commands has response packets which are in the form of "event"

		For this group, the process of getting response data is different from
		the delayed response types.  In addition to calling the GSDI request command,
		the function QLIB_GSDIDIAG_GetEventResponse() must be called to get the request
		response information.

		An example of this can be seen in QLibDemo.cpp, in the function Test_Security(),
		which calls QLIB_GSDIDIAG_GET_FEATURE_INDICATION_CMD()

		If the request command is not directly available in QMSL, it is possible to send

	This is a MediaFLO "helper function" which calls one of the MediaFLO Diagnostic ICD
	API's to perform a specialized task.

	This function measures the Physical layer packet error rate.  This type of packet 
	error rate measurement does not require a known nor finite sequence of FTAP packets 
	from the FLO Tx Waveform.  The measurement is made by querying the accumulated PLP 
	statistics for all requested Flow IDs.  Accumulated statistics continue to be queried 
	until the minimum number of PLPs have been recorded.	Accumulated PLP statistics 
	are queried through the QLIB_MFLO_GET_MLC_PLP_STAT_DYN_PARAMS function. 

	After calling QLIB_MFLO_RST_PLP_STATS to reset the accumulated statistics for all
	MLCs, this function may be called repeatedly until the desired level of confidence 
	is achieved.
	
	The time period that is used when checking for status is controlled by the
	timing index QMSL_Timeout_Delay_MediaFLO_StatusCheck, to be used with the functions 
	QLIB_ConfigureTimeOut() and QLIB_GetTimeOut().
