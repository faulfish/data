        <h2>Colors and Style</h2>
                        <div class="item "><span class="">OmniDiskSweeper uses colors and style to tell you about your files. Colors are used to group files by size and to show the status of a file or folder. The style of the text distinguishes between actual files and their aliases. </span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">OmniDiskSweeper displays file sizes along a spectrum between light green and light purple. File sizes marked in light green are the smallest files and as they get larger in size the sizes are displayed as dark green and then dark purple and finally light purple.</span>                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="LightPurple">Light Purple</span>: Files measured in <a href="help:anchor='gigabytes' bookID='OmniDiskSweeper Help'">Gigabytes</a>.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="DarkPurple">Dark Purple</span>: Files measured in <a href="help:anchor='megabytes' bookID='OmniDiskSweeper Help'">Megabytes</a>.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="DarkGreen">Dark Green</span>: Files measured in <a href="help:anchor='kilobytes' bookID='OmniDiskSweeper Help'">Kilobytes</a>.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="LightGreen">Light Green</span>: Files measured in <a href="help:anchor='bytes' bookID='OmniDiskSweeper Help'">Bytes</a>.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Red">Red</span>: Files whose sizes are still being calculated.</span>                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">OmniDiskSweeper also displays file names in the following colors to indicate the state of the file:</span>                            <div class="item "><span class="">Black: Files that are not part of a <a href="help:anchor='package' bookID='OmniDiskSweeper Help'">package</a> and are generally okay to delete. However, not all files marked in black are useless so you should always consider what applications are using that file.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Gray">Gray</span>: Files that are part of a <a href="help:anchor='package' bookID='OmniDiskSweeper Help'">package</a> and typically should not be deleted.</span>                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">Finally, OmniDiskSweeper uses italic font to indicate files that are <a href="help:anchor='symboliclinks' bookID='OmniDiskSweeper Help'">symbolic links</a> to other files or folders on your hard drive. Typically you don't want to delete these files unless you created them yourself. </span>                        </div>
