                        <div class="item "><span class="Bold">Drive Size</span>                            <div class="item "><span class="">The selected drive and the amount of data found on it are displayed in the title bar of the browser window. As you delete files, this number automatically updates. Please remember that OmniDiskSweeper can only display files and folders that are accessible by the current user. If you do not have access to some restricted folders, neither will OmniDiskSweeper. As a result, the Finder may say that you have 17 GB used but OmniDiskSweeper may only show you 10 GB of the data.</span>                            </div>
