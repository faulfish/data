        <h2>Symbolic Link</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">A symbolic link is similar to an alias in that it is a file that points to another file or folder on your hard drive. Symbolic links point to a particular location on your hard drive regardless of what file is there. If you change the location of a file you had a symbolic link to, the link will still point to the original location. Aliases recognize the changes you make and stay linked even if you move the file or rename it. Generally you will not run into symbolic links too much and you should not delete them if you are not confident with these kinds of links.</span>                            </div>
