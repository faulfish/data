                        <div class="item "><span class="">OmniDiskSweeper has three different types of licenses:</span>                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Personal:</span> This license is for your personal use, and will only be available on this computer when you are logged on as the user who installed the license. You can install this license on more than one computer, but only for your personal use. You should not use the software on two different computers at the same time with this kind of license. If a personal license is available, the application will always use it.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Computer:</span> You can use this license on this computer, and so can any other user of this computer. However, you should not install this license on more than one computer. If both a network license and a computer license are available, the application will prefer the computer license. Additionally, this license does not accommodate fast-user switching so multiple users on this computer cannot be running OmniDiskSweeper at the same time.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Network:</span> This license sits on your network and is available to any user on the network. However, only a certain number of users (indicated by the number of &quot;seats&quot;) can use the license at one time. OmniDiskSweeper will only use a network license if neither a personal nor a computer license is available.</span>                            </div>

First, find the license file on the old computer. OmniDiskSweeper license files are located in the folder <span class="Verbatim">Library/Application Support/Omni Group/Software Licenses</span>, where <span class="Verbatim">Library</span> is either at the top level of your system disk (for computer licenses), or in your home folder (for personal licenses). The file you are looking for has a name like <span class="Verbatim">OmniDiskSweeper-123456.omnilicense</span>. Move this file to the new computer.</span>                            </div>
