Unfortunately, we sometimes fill our hard drives with a lot of files that take up too much space. The most frustrating part is that we do it without knowing—that's where OmniDiskSweeper comes in.</span>                        </div>
                        <div class="item "><span class="">OmniDiskSweeper is a Mac OS X utility for quickly finding and deleting big, useless files and thus making space on your hard drives. OmniDiskSweeper makes this easy by highlighting the biggest files on your drives, and by noting which files are used by the system, so you don't accidentally delete important files.</span>                        </div>
                        <div class="item "><span class="Important Note">Important: When you use OmniDiskSweeper you will have the option to remove files from your hard drives. You cannot undo after you have deleted a file so make sure you really want to get rid of it forever before clicking <span class="UI">Delete</span>. </span>                        </div>
