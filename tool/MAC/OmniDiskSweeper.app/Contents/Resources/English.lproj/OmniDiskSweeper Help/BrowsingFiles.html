It may take some time to determine the size of volumes and large folders. Sizes that are still being calculated appear in red. Folders that OmniDiskSweeper hasn't even begun to size will have no size listed, and will be at the end of the list.</span>                        </div>

The folders and files are displayed in a column view, similar to a Finder window. You can quickly navigate within folders to get down to the exact folders you want to browse. Simply click on a folder name and its contents are displayed in the column on the right. Continue to select folders until you find the file or folder you are looking for.</span>                        </div>
